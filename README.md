This repository contains a collection of exercises, code samples, and notes developed while studying the Go programming language. The goal is to build a solid understanding of Go's core features and idiomatic patterns, with a focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

As part of my ongoing education in software development, I'm currently studying Go (Golang), a statically typed and compiled language designed at Google. This repository serves as both a personal reference and a demonstration of progress throughout the course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop fluency in the Go programming language
- Understand Goâ€™s approach to type systems, interfaces, and concurrency
- Write idiomatic Go code following best practices and design patterns
- Apply Go to practical use cases including CLI tools, web servers, and concurrent applications

## ðŸ§° Tools & Environment

- **Go** (latest stable version)
- **Visual Studio Code** with Go extensions / GoLand
- **Git** for version control
- **Go Modules** for dependency management
